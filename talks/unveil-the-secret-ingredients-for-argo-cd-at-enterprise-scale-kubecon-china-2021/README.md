**Abstract**:

Unlike the fact that there is no secret ingredient in Kung Fu Pandaâ€™s noodle soup, a good amount of effort has been baked into the enterprise-scale Argo CD product. Do you know Argo CD can support thousands of applications? Have you tried to connect hundreds of Kubernetes clusters? What about the case with thousands of objects in a single application? We will deep dive into the Argo CD product, bring answers and best practices to you. In addition, several great synergy examples with other Argo products will be shared and discussed.
