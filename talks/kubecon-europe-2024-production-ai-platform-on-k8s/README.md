# Production-Ready AI Platform on Kubernetes

**Abstract:**

In recent years, advances in ML/AI have made tremendous progress yet designing large-scale data science and machine learning applications still remain challenging. The variety of machine learning frameworks, hardware accelerators, cloud vendors as well as the complexity of data science workflows brings new challenges to MLOps. For example, it’s non-trivial to build an inference system that’s suitable for models of different sizes, especially for LLMs or large models in general. This talk presents various best practices and challenges on building large, efficient, scalable, and reliable AI/ML platforms using cloud-native technologies such as Kubernetes, Kubeflow, and KServe. We will deep dive into a reference platform dedicated for modern cloud-native AI infrastructure.
